# Guard: a version was bumped in a manifest, but nothing in the delivery cuts a release.
#
# The scar (2026-07-30). A version went to 2.2.0 in the plugin manifests, the CHANGELOG
# gained its section, the PR merged green, and the delivery was reported as "merged,
# public". The owner opened the repository and saw **2.0.0**. Both statements were true
# and only one mattered: the code was on the default branch, and no tag or release had
# ever been cut for 2.1.0 or 2.2.0. A version bump is invisible to everyone who is not
# reading the diff — the release IS the shop window.
#
# The general failure, which is why this is a guard and not a note: "merged" and
# "released" are different events, and a manifest bump looks exactly like the second
# while being only the first. It is the same shape as "the deploy is READY" or "the OTA
# was built" — a step that FEELS terminal and is not.
#
# WARN, never FAIL: plenty of healthy workflows bump the version in one commit and tag
# in a later one, and release automation (release-please, changesets, semantic-release,
# a tag-triggered workflow) legitimately does the cutting elsewhere. So this asks the
# question and names what to check; it does not block. It also stays quiet when the diff
# shows the release being handled — a tag-triggered workflow, a release job, or a
# release-automation config.
